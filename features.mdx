## Real-time Multiplayer Gameplay

Engage players in synchronized sessions across devices. Wamba uses WebSockets for bidirectional communication, ensuring actions like movement or attacks update instantly for all participants.

Connect to a game session with this example:

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.wamba.com/ws/game/{gameId}?token=YOUR_TOKEN');
  ws.onopen = () => console.log('Connected to multiplayer session');
  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    updateGameState(data);
  };
  ```
  ```python
  import websocket
  import json

  ws = websocket.WebSocket()
  ws.connect('wss://api.wamba.com/ws/game/{gameId}?token=YOUR_TOKEN')
  print('Connected to multiplayer session')
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Pass `{gameId}` from the `/games/join` API endpoint to start sessions.
</Callout>

## Esports Tournament System

Build and run tournaments with automatic bracketing, seeding, and payouts. You define rules, entry fees, and prize pools via the dashboard.

## Leaderboards and Rankings

View dynamic rankings updated every `5s`. Filter by game mode, region, or time period (daily, weekly, all-time).

|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1    | ProGamerX | 12500 | NA     |
| 2    | ShadowBlade | 11850 | EU     |
| 3    | QuickScope | 11200 | APAC   |

Embed leaderboards in your app:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.wamba.com/leaderboards/global?limit=10')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => renderLeaderboard(data));
```

    Chat channel ID.
  </ParamField>

    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN` }
  });
  ```
